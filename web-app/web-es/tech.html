          <p class="column-text">This runtime architecture displays the two ongoing processes in the EverySecond system. On one end,
          the recording device and cloud function feed images and data into the Event Index; on the other end, cloud functions process
          requests from the web app to filter through the Event Index and return the requested event images.</p>

            <p class="column-text text-left" style="margin: 0px 100px;">EverySecond uses a customized object detection model. The model
                was trained using Google's AutoML system. For data collection, the development team powered a RaspberryPi
                camera and captured timelapse images of daily events. Then, the team meticulously drew bounding boxes
                around medicine bottles, plates, and faces over the thousands of images. The model took approximately one
                day to finish training.<br><br><br></p>
            <p class="column-header"><b>Image Uploading and Processing</b></p>
            <img src="media/cloud-processing.jpg" style="max-width: 480px; padding: 0px 0px 30px; 0px"></img>
            <p class="column-text text-left" style="margin: 0px 100px;">A Google Cloud Function reacts to the incoming photos uploaded by the
                RaspberryPi device. When an image lands in a bucket, the arrival triggers a cloud function, which takes
                the image and puts the image through the object detection model. The model returns the present labels on
                the image. Having the image and the image's data (labels, timestamp, path, etc.), the cloud function inputs
                the data into the Google Cloud Datastore.<br><br><br></p>
            <p class="column-header col"><b>Request and Response</b></p>

            <p class="column-text text-left" style="margin: 0px 100px;">The user clicks on the web app button to view the last instance of a specific
                event (for example, taking medication). This action prompts the web app to send a GET request to the datastore with certain filters
                on the wanted labels and time range. The datastore picks out the images with the required data, but it doesn't have the physical
                image. Instead, it provides the image path: the image is stored in a Google Storage Bucket. Then, the web app receives all the data
                about the image and formats it to display the images in a carousel.<br><br></p>

            <h1 class="column-header text-center">Quick Q&A!</h1>
            <p class="column-text"><i>Why is EverySecond limited to these three events? Can EverySecond track more events?</i></p>
            <p class="column-text">Through research and connections, We've learned that the most common issues with Alzheimer's
                patients involve monitoring the patient's medication, food, and interactions with people.<br>EverySecond, with
                the necessary training, can track all objects and events. We'd just need to gather enough image data and gather
                enough people to label bounding boxes, or we can employ existing object detection models.<br><br></p>
            <p class="column-text"><i>Why the RaspberyPi device? Aren't there more powerful devices with impressive GPUs?</i></p>
            <p class="column-text">The RaspberryPi is a convenient, small device that easily uploads images online. Although
                devices by NVIDIA are more powerful with their GPUs, they are bulkier and cost lots of battery power. However,
                if edge devices become smaller and more power efficient, I will definitely consider using them instead because
                they will process the image on-device rather than in the cloud, which reduces the inference cost.<br><br></p>
            <p class="column-text"><i>What if the user doesn't want to wear the RaspberryPi device? Can the user still use EverySecond?</i></p>
            <p class="column-text">Yes! The user can position the RaspberryPi in a stationary location (for example, at the counter
                where the user takes medicine) and keep track of image data. Additionally, the user may even use his/her own
                recording device to upload photos into the Google Bucket, where the Cloud Functions will still process them.<br><br></p>
