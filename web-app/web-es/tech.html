            <p class="column-text text-left" style="margin: 0px 100px;">EverySecond uses a personalized object detection model. The model
                was trained from Google's AutoML system. For data collection, the development team powered a RaspberryPi
                camera and captured timelapse images of daily events. Then, the team meticulously drew bounding boxes
                around medicine bottles, plates, and faces over the thousands of images. The model took approximately one
                day to finish training. It was very easy to implement in a cloud function, requiring only a model ID number.<br><br></p>
            <p class="column-header"><b>Cloud Functions</b></p>
            <img src="media/cloud-processing.jpg" style="max-width: 480px; padding: 0px 0px 30px; 0px"></img>
            <p class="column-text text-left" style="margin: 0px 100px;">The Google Cloud Function reacts to the incoming photos uploaded by the
                RaspberryPi device. When an image lands in a bucket, the arrival triggers a cloud function, which takes
                the image and puts the image through the object detection model. The model returns the present labels on
                the image. Having the image and the image's data (labels, timestamp, path, etc.), the cloud function inputs
                the data into the Google Cloud Datastore.<br><br></p>
            <p class="column-header col"><b>Request and Response</b></p>
            <img src="media/recall.jpg" style="max-width: 480px; padding: 0px 0px 30px; 0px;"></img>
            <p class="column-text text-left" style="margin: 0px 100px;">The user clicks on the web app button to view the last instance of a specific event (for example, taking medication). This action prompts the web app to send a GET request to the datastore with certain filters on the wanted labels and time range. The datastore picks out the images with the required data, but it doesn't have the physical image. Instead, it provides the image path: the image is stored in a Google Storage Bucket. Thus, the web app receives all the data about the image and formats it to display the images in a carousel.<br></p>

            <h1 class="column-header text-center">Q&A</h1>
            <p class="column-text"><i>What inspired you to create this app?</i></p>
            <p class="column-text">My inspiration for this app stems from my family friend's situation and my curiosity for new
                technologies in the area of artificial intelligence and machine learning.<br><br>My family friend’s mother currently
                experiences Alzheimer’s disease, so I’ve heard about my friend’s struggles in caring for his mother. He lives apart from
                her, but he noted that he occasionally needs to keep an eye on his mother’s medicine consumption, food intake, and
                possible instances of elder abuse. To him, knowing these three aspects would provide him peace of mind. Currently,
                he facetimes his mother every evening to ask about her day, but his conversations often lead nowhere because of his
                mother’s condition. My friend’s story inspired me to create an app that could ease his concerns, and his three specific
                areas of focus led me to add in the three objects to detect.<br><br>Furthermore, throughout my whole childhood,
                I was genuinely interested in technology, building small projects here and there and creating my website. When
                I first heard about machine learning, the concept seemed almost magical to me because it seemed like the computer
                itself could write its code and analyze data. I immediately knew I wanted to create a project with an element of
                machine learning.<br><br>Faced with a problem and eager to try out a novel technology, I set out to create EverySecond.
                EverySecond addresses and solves the concerns many people have with their older relatives. This app was an opportunity
                for me to foster my interest in computer science and create a technology that could benefit others.<br><br></p>
            <p class="column-text"><i>What technical difficulties did you face?</i></p>
            <p class="column-text">The first technical difficulty involved not the actual code of the project but what devices and
                platforms to even code on. When I started my project, I knew that I needed a small camera device. I first tested the
                Google Clips Camera, which automatically takes pictures and saves the most interesting ones into a phone to create a
                “highlight of the day.” However, I couldn’t alter the code inside the camera since it was a consumer product, and other
                wearable cameras had the same issue. I finally chose the Raspberry Pi Zero.  The Pi Zero has a camera attachment and
                easily carried out my programmed tasks.<br><br>Next, I needed to find a platform that could accept and process the photos
                from the Raspberry Pi. I considered using a container, but the container required a computer server to run continuously
                and was also too complex for me to learn in a few months. My solution was the Google Cloud Console, which provided APIs
                 with detailed documentation. Google’s Cloud Functions allowed my project to operate serverless.</p>
